This is a Chrome Extension to remotely control a Transmission install via Transmission-rpc. Compared to Remote
Transmission Plus, from which this was forked, Remote Transmission++ (that's one plus better) plans to update this
extension to work with the latest versions of Chrome and Transmission.

I'm trying to conform to a [certain Git branching setup](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), which
hopefully explains all the branches and merges that I've been trying to do.
